# Fil de Fer
Environment : MacOS - Yosemite

'Fil de Fer' is a map-reader that reads files formated as a table containing heights in each "cells". Each cells has to be separed by a space, and each row by a NewLine character. I am using an unofficial graphical library called MinilibX almost only containing a function used to put a colored point in a X11 graphical window.

Example of map file :
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 1 2 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Technologies used :
- C
- MinilibX

(Won't work on Linux, this version of MinilibX is only for MacOS)
